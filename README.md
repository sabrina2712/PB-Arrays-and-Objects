This repository contains multiple `ExerciseN.md` files make sure to work on them in their numeric order.
You will realize that for some tasks you will need to google and be creative.

If you are stuck, ask a fellow student.

As always use the sticky notes on our wall to make sure we repeat topics that give you a hard time.
